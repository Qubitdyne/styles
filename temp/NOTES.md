# Texas Greenbook 15th Edition — Working Notes

Use this file to capture the minimum context required to resume work quickly. Detailed historical research logs are archived in `temp/archive/NOTES-2025-12-21.md`.

## Active research threads
- **Publication/status helpers:** The prototype in `temp/prototypes/` already demonstrates how to collapse session law and agency parentheticals. The next implementation pass needs Greenbook Chapter 10–13 references confirming when to emit `Supp.`, `R.S.`, and similar status tags.
- **TOA federal coverage:** Appendix B examples require the grouped TOA layout to interleave federal authorities with Texas entries. Document any sorting or heading decisions here once the fixtures are restored.
- **Session stability:** Record the command(s) you run at the end of each block of work (including any failing cases) so recovery is straightforward if a session terminates unexpectedly.

## Quick reference links
- `temp/TODO.md` — trimmed active backlog.
- `temp/PR_DRAFT.md` — running narrative for the eventual upstream pull request.
- `temp/Greenbook_15thEdition.pdf` — authoritative rule text; note page numbers here when citing new guidance.

## When pausing work
1. Summarize what changed, what still needs attention, and where to look next (tests, macros, etc.).
2. Note any commands to rerun along with expected outcomes.
3. If additional detail is required but would bloat this file, drop a dated note into `temp/archive/` and link to it from here.
