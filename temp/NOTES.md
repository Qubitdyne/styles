## Chapter Highlights
### Chapter 1 – Briefs and Legal Memoranda (pp. 3–5)
- Distinguishes roman and italic typefaces for pleadings, allowing large and small capitals for emphasis consistent with recent Bluebook updates (1.0, 1.5).
- Requires italicizing introductory signals, case names, and publication titles while keeping reporter, jurisdiction, and author names in roman type (1.1–1.3).
- Notes stylistic italics limits, foreign word treatment, and directs that statutes, rules, and other authorities remain in roman type (1.5–1.6).

### Chapter 2 – Texas Supreme Court (pp. 7–9)
- Basic citations include case name, South Western Reporter reference, pinpoint page, and “Tex.” parenthetical with year; subsequent history appended when relevant (2.1.1).
- Slip opinions must cite electronic sources with cause numbers, pinpoint references, and date; paginated slip opinions use “slip op.” with page numbers, and Texas Supreme Court Journal citations add volume/page plus electronic parallel cites (2.1.2).
- U.S. Supreme Court dispositions are included except older cert. denials; historical guidance distinguishes Texas Reports-only periods and when parallel citations may be required (2.2–2.3).

### Chapter 3 – Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (pp. 10–13)
- Current citations mirror Supreme Court format with “Tex. Crim. App.” parentheticals and warnings that unpublished opinions lack precedential value (3.1.1).
- Panel opinions (1978–1982) require “[Panel Op.]” and electronic slip citations follow the same cause-number conventions, including paragraph pinpoints when pagination is absent (3.1.2–3.1.3).
- Subsequent history captures U.S. Supreme Court review, and historical notes explain when Texas Criminal Reports parallel citations become necessary (3.2–3.3).

### Chapter 4 – Courts of Appeals (pp. 14–27)
- Post-1981 cases cite only the South Western Reporter with em-dash-separated city designations, writ/petition histories, and optional weight-of-authority parentheticals (4.1.1).
- Memorandum, per curiam, and “not designated for publication” designations require explicit parentheticals, with distinctions between civil and criminal publication practices and pre-2003 “do not publish” notes (4.1.2).
- Recent opinions rely on electronic citations paralleling slip-opinion rules; historic instructions cover pre-1981 civil appeals reporters, city identification (including special Houston rules), and petition/writ notation tables (4.1.3–4.7, 4.2–4.6).

### Chapter 5 – Commission of Appeals (pp. 28–30)

## Existing CSL Style Inventory

### Bluebook-Derived Styles
- **bluebook-law-review.csl** keeps an `en-US` default locale with custom term overrides for verbs such as "ed." and "trans." alongside a bespoke `author`/`author-short` stack that toggles italics and small caps based on item type, mirroring the Bluebook note hierarchy.【F:bluebook-law-review.csl†L2-L91】 Its `source`, `issuance`, and `container` macros orchestrate conditional reporter versus periodical layouts, including year-bearing parentheticals and pinpoint delivery, while the citation layout uses `ibid`, `supra`, and locator logic gated by position testing.【F:bluebook-law-review.csl†L122-L388】
- **bluebook-law-review-with-abstract.csl** inherits the same macro set, adding only metadata changes and retaining the Bluebook-driven `source` cascade and term overrides, so any adjustments can be centralized in the shared macro names without diverging layouts.【F:bluebook-law-review-with-abstract.csl†L2-L188】
- **bluebook-inline.csl** exposes reusable `source-short` and `source-long` macros for parallel inline versus full-text cites, coupled with an `access` macro that emits "last visited" parentheticals—useful patterns for Greenbook slip-opinion URLs and short-form logic in in-text contexts.【F:bluebook-inline.csl†L1-L200】
- **law-citation-manual.csl** layers multilingual locales (`zh` and `en`) with tailored date formats, symbol terms, and macros that segment source handling across legislation, legal cases, blogs, and secondary authorities—demonstrating how locale-specific macros (`source-zh`, `access-zh`) can coexist with an English template lineage from `bluebook-law-review`.【F:law-citation-manual.csl†L1-L200】

### Legal-Prefix Dependent Styles
- **dependent/legal-medicine.csl** and **dependent/legal-and-criminological-psychology.csl** are thin wrappers that delegate entirely to `elsevier-with-titles` and `apa`, respectively; they only set metadata and locales, so any substantive behavior must be driven through the parent styles rather than direct edits.【F:dependent/legal-medicine.csl†L1-L14】【F:dependent/legal-and-criminological-psychology.csl†L1-L16】

### Texas Greenbook Drafts and TOA Variants
- **Draft 0** implements a minimal Greenbook approximation with generic macros (`case-cite`, `statute-cite`, `article-cite`) and uniform bibliography/citation routing, lacking template inheritance or specialized Texas variables such as `status` or `collection-number`. This serves as a baseline for feature gaps (no slip-opinion handling, no municipal code logic).【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft0.csl†L1-L195】
- **Draft 1** pivots to a Bluebook template, introducing Greenbook-specific macros for constitutions, statutes, administrative codes, and TOA-ready parentheticals; it also adds `subsequent-history` handling via the `references` variable and expands the citation chooser to cover regulations, reports, and web materials.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft1.csl†L1-L280】
- **Draft 2** restructures the architecture around type-focused macros (`legal-case`, `session-law`, `tac-core`, `municipal-code`, `ag-opinion`) and introduces conditional branching on variables like `volume`, `authority`, and `chapter-number` to distinguish codes versus constitutions, hinting at the data-shaping expected from translators or pre-processing layers.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft2.csl†L1-L359】
- **Draft 3** retains the Draft 2 macro library while layering in additional fallbacks (`book-like`, `web`) and a revised citation switch that defers to master templates for cases, statutes, and regulations. It also embeds `weight-parentheticals` and `pinpoint` logic for Westlaw citations, illustrating how to mix print and electronic reporters within the same macro stack.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft3.csl†L1-L428】
- **Table-of-Authorities variants** (e.g., `texas-greenbook-15th-toa.csl`, `texas-greenbook-15th-toa-grouped-leaders.csl`) reuse the master macros but customize bibliography sorting, grouping, and dotted-leader output, showing how TOA requirements can be met with selective macro reuse and layout tweaks.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-toa.csl†L1-L166】【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-toa-grouped-leaders.csl†L1-L190】

### Patterns Requiring Greenbook-Specific Adaptation
- Bluebook macros heavily rely on `ibid`, `supra`, and symbol-based author formatting; Greenbook short-form rules will need alternative position handling (e.g., "Id." versus "supra" suppression) and customized italics behavior for case names within short cites.【F:bluebook-law-review.csl†L320-L384】
- The Draft 2/3 macros expect structured variables (`authority`, `status`, `collection-number`) that may not be present in raw Zotero data; translators or plugins will need to map Greenbook fields (petition histories, docket numbers) into these slots or extend macros to compute fallbacks.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft2.csl†L52-L112】【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft3.csl†L267-L323】
- TOA layouts currently output leaders using static text and rely on type-based grouping; Greenbook's alphabetical subsections (e.g., Cases subdivided by jurisdiction) may require enhanced sort keys and localized headings beyond the numeric group tokens seen in the grouped-leaders variant.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-toa-grouped-leaders.csl†L116-L189】
- None of the drafts yet automate slip-opinion parentheticals, cite-check signals, or court/region abbreviations; leveraging Bluebook inline patterns for cause-number reporting and `access` macros could bridge this gap for Greenbook electronic sources.【F:bluebook-inline.csl†L27-L101】【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft1.csl†L196-L226】

## Unresolved Questions & Follow-Up Items
1. **Uniform Format Manual OCR:** The PDF appears to be image-based; confirm whether an OCR text version is available to extract precise citation requirements.
2. **TRCP/TRAP Cross-References:** Validate whether additional rules (beyond TRCP 21 and TRAP 47/52) are incorporated by the Greenbook for future automation (e.g., TRAP 9 formatting, TRCP 297 findings).
3. **Legacy Reporter Availability:** Determine availability of historical reporters (Robards, White & Willson, Posey) for automated citation validation.
