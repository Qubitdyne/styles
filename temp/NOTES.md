## Chapter Highlights
### Chapter 1 – Briefs and Legal Memoranda (pp. 3–5)
- Distinguishes roman and italic typefaces for pleadings, allowing large and small capitals for emphasis consistent with recent Bluebook updates (1.0, 1.5).
- Requires italicizing introductory signals, case names, and publication titles while keeping reporter, jurisdiction, and author names in roman type (1.1–1.3).
- Notes stylistic italics limits, foreign word treatment, and directs that statutes, rules, and other authorities remain in roman type (1.5–1.6).

### Chapter 2 – Texas Supreme Court (pp. 7–9)
- Basic citations include case name, South Western Reporter reference, pinpoint page, and “Tex.” parenthetical with year; subsequent history appended when relevant (2.1.1).
- Slip opinions must cite electronic sources with cause numbers, pinpoint references, and date; paginated slip opinions use “slip op.” with page numbers, and Texas Supreme Court Journal citations add volume/page plus electronic parallel cites (2.1.2).
- U.S. Supreme Court dispositions are included except older cert. denials; historical guidance distinguishes Texas Reports-only periods and when parallel citations may be required (2.2–2.3).

### Chapter 3 – Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (pp. 10–13)
- Current citations mirror Supreme Court format with “Tex. Crim. App.” parentheticals and warnings that unpublished opinions lack precedential value (3.1.1).
- Panel opinions (1978–1982) require “[Panel Op.]” and electronic slip citations follow the same cause-number conventions, including paragraph pinpoints when pagination is absent (3.1.2–3.1.3).
- Subsequent history captures U.S. Supreme Court review, and historical notes explain when Texas Criminal Reports parallel citations become necessary (3.2–3.3).

### Chapter 4 – Courts of Appeals (pp. 14–27)
- Post-1981 cases cite only the South Western Reporter with em-dash-separated city designations, writ/petition histories, and optional weight-of-authority parentheticals (4.1.1).
- Memorandum, per curiam, and “not designated for publication” designations require explicit parentheticals, with distinctions between civil and criminal publication practices and pre-2003 “do not publish” notes (4.1.2).
- Recent opinions rely on electronic citations paralleling slip-opinion rules; historic instructions cover pre-1981 civil appeals reporters, city identification (including special Houston rules), and petition/writ notation tables (4.1.3–4.7, 4.2–4.6).

### Chapter 5 – Commission of Appeals (pp. 28–30)

### Chapter 7 – Trial Courts (pp. 34–36)

- Establishes naming conventions for subject-matter codes, historical facts, supplements, and multi-section citations; differentiates codified, uncodified, independent, and auxiliary laws (10.1–10.2).
- Session-law citations require statute name, legislature/session, chapter/section, publication, and location; unpublished statutes, electronic sources, and municipal ordinances receive specialized formats (10.3–10.6).

### Chapter 11 – Statutes No Longer in Effect (pp. 54–56)

## Unresolved Questions & Follow-Up Items
1. **Uniform Format Manual OCR:** The PDF appears to be image-based; confirm whether an OCR text version is available to extract precise citation requirements.
2. **TRCP/TRAP Cross-References:** Validate whether additional rules (beyond TRCP 21 and TRAP 47/52) are incorporated by the Greenbook for future automation (e.g., TRAP 9 formatting, TRCP 297 findings).
3. **Legacy Reporter Availability:** Determine availability of historical reporters (Robards, White & Willson, Posey) for automated citation validation.
