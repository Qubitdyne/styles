## Existing CSL Style Inventory

### Bluebook-Derived Styles
- **bluebook-law-review.csl** keeps an `en-US` default locale with custom term overrides for verbs such as "ed." and "trans." alongside a bespoke `author`/`author-short` stack that toggles italics and small caps based on item type, mirroring the Bluebook note hierarchy.【F:bluebook-law-review.csl†L2-L91】 Its `source`, `issuance`, and `container` macros orchestrate conditional reporter versus periodical layouts, including year-bearing parentheticals and pinpoint delivery, while the citation layout uses `ibid`, `supra`, and locator logic gated by position testing.【F:bluebook-law-review.csl†L122-L388】
- **bluebook-law-review-with-abstract.csl** inherits the same macro set, adding only metadata changes and retaining the Bluebook-driven `source` cascade and term overrides, so any adjustments can be centralized in the shared macro names without diverging layouts.【F:bluebook-law-review-with-abstract.csl†L2-L188】
- **bluebook-inline.csl** exposes reusable `source-short` and `source-long` macros for parallel inline versus full-text cites, coupled with an `access` macro that emits "last visited" parentheticals—useful patterns for Greenbook slip-opinion URLs and short-form logic in in-text contexts.【F:bluebook-inline.csl†L1-L200】
- **law-citation-manual.csl** layers multilingual locales (`zh` and `en`) with tailored date formats, symbol terms, and macros that segment source handling across legislation, legal cases, blogs, and secondary authorities—demonstrating how locale-specific macros (`source-zh`, `access-zh`) can coexist with an English template lineage from `bluebook-law-review`.【F:law-citation-manual.csl†L1-L200】

### Legal-Prefix Dependent Styles
- **dependent/legal-medicine.csl** and **dependent/legal-and-criminological-psychology.csl** are thin wrappers that delegate entirely to `elsevier-with-titles` and `apa`, respectively; they only set metadata and locales, so any substantive behavior must be driven through the parent styles rather than direct edits.【F:dependent/legal-medicine.csl†L1-L14】【F:dependent/legal-and-criminological-psychology.csl†L1-L16】

### Texas Greenbook Drafts and TOA Variants
- **Draft 0** implements a minimal Greenbook approximation with generic macros (`case-cite`, `statute-cite`, `article-cite`) and uniform bibliography/citation routing, lacking template inheritance or specialized Texas variables such as `status` or `collection-number`. This serves as a baseline for feature gaps (no slip-opinion handling, no municipal code logic).【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft0.csl†L1-L195】
- **Draft 1** pivots to a Bluebook template, introducing Greenbook-specific macros for constitutions, statutes, administrative codes, and TOA-ready parentheticals; it also adds `subsequent-history` handling via the `references` variable and expands the citation chooser to cover regulations, reports, and web materials.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft1.csl†L1-L280】
- **Draft 2** restructures the architecture around type-focused macros (`legal-case`, `session-law`, `tac-core`, `municipal-code`, `ag-opinion`) and introduces conditional branching on variables like `volume`, `authority`, and `chapter-number` to distinguish codes versus constitutions, hinting at the data-shaping expected from translators or pre-processing layers.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft2.csl†L1-L359】
- **Draft 3** retains the Draft 2 macro library while layering in additional fallbacks (`book-like`, `web`) and a revised citation switch that defers to master templates for cases, statutes, and regulations. It also embeds `weight-parentheticals` and `pinpoint` logic for Westlaw citations, illustrating how to mix print and electronic reporters within the same macro stack.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft3.csl†L1-L428】
- **Table-of-Authorities variants** (e.g., `texas-greenbook-15th-toa.csl`, `texas-greenbook-15th-toa-grouped-leaders.csl`) reuse the master macros but customize bibliography sorting, grouping, and dotted-leader output, showing how TOA requirements can be met with selective macro reuse and layout tweaks.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-toa.csl†L1-L166】【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-toa-grouped-leaders.csl†L1-L190】

### Missing Shared Helpers and Required Additions
- **Case law pipeline**
  - *Pinpoints*: Current `pinpoint` macro distinguishes print versus Westlaw but cannot emit multiple pincites or textual locators (e.g., `at *4`, `slip op. at`). Add a shared helper that normalizes slip-opinion locators (e.g., `pinpoint-slip`) and allows comma-delimited pincite arrays for both note and bibliography contexts.
  - *Parentheticals*: `weight-parentheticals` only reads `genre`/`medium`; introduce a generalized `explanatory-parenthetical` helper that can handle procedural phrases (`per curiam`, `mem. op.`, `orig. proceeding`) by inspecting `status`, `genre`, and custom fields.
  - *Docket metadata*: Add a shared `docket-block` helper to capture `collection-number` and `number` for slip opinions and mandamus proceedings so that `legal-case` and mandamus-specific macros can reuse the logic.
- **Statutory/constitution pipeline**
  - *Pinpoints*: No macro supports subsection pinpoints beyond single `section`. Implement a `section-pinpoint` helper that accepts `section`, `subdivision`, and paragraph indicators to support statutory notes and constitutional subsections.
  - *Parentheticals*: `tex-statute` inlines supplemental notes but lacks shared logic for publisher/year parentheticals. Create a `publication-parenthetical` helper to compute `(West 2025)` style phrases shared between statutes, constitutions, and rules.
  - *Docket metadata*: For session laws and legislative history, add a `legislative-history-metadata` helper to unify bill number, session, and disposition fields for use across `session-law` and future committee-report macros.
- **Administrative/rule pipeline**
  - *Pinpoints*: `tex-admin-code` and `tac-core` emit only single sections. Extend with a `rule-pinpoint` helper that accommodates `note`, `appendix`, or comment locators (e.g., `cmt. to 1997 change`).
  - *Parentheticals*: Introduce a shared `status-parenthetical` helper that formats `adopted`, `emergency rule`, or `effective` notes for both TAC and Register citations using `status`/`note` variables.
  - *Docket metadata*: Agency orders and ethics opinions use numbers (`No.`, `Op.`) but rely on bespoke text. Build a `agency-docket` helper to standardize authority + opinion number handling for `ag-opinion`, `municipal-code`, and forthcoming agency-material macros.

### Patterns Requiring Greenbook-Specific Adaptation
- Bluebook macros heavily rely on `ibid`, `supra`, and symbol-based author formatting; Greenbook short-form rules will need alternative position handling (e.g., "Id." versus "supra" suppression) and customized italics behavior for case names within short cites.【F:bluebook-law-review.csl†L320-L384】
- The Draft 2/3 macros expect structured variables (`authority`, `status`, `collection-number`) that may not be present in raw Zotero data; translators or plugins will need to map Greenbook fields (petition histories, docket numbers) into these slots or extend macros to compute fallbacks.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft2.csl†L52-L112】【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft3.csl†L267-L323】
- TOA layouts currently output leaders using static text and rely on type-based grouping; Greenbook's alphabetical subsections (e.g., Cases subdivided by jurisdiction) may require enhanced sort keys and localized headings beyond the numeric group tokens seen in the grouped-leaders variant.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-toa-grouped-leaders.csl†L116-L189】
- None of the drafts yet automate slip-opinion parentheticals, cite-check signals, or court/region abbreviations; leveraging Bluebook inline patterns for cause-number reporting and `access` macros could bridge this gap for Greenbook electronic sources.【F:bluebook-inline.csl†L27-L101】【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft1.csl†L196-L226】

## Unresolved Questions & Follow-Up Items
1. **Uniform Format Manual OCR:** The PDF appears to be image-based; confirm whether an OCR text version is available to extract precise citation requirements.
2. **TRCP/TRAP Cross-References:** Validate whether additional rules (beyond TRCP 21 and TRAP 47/52) are incorporated by the Greenbook for future automation (e.g., TRAP 9 formatting, TRCP 297 findings).
3. **Legacy Reporter Availability:** Determine availability of historical reporters (Robards, White & Willson, Posey) for automated citation validation.

## Citation Matrix Completeness Review
- The matrix enumerates every substantive category appearing in the Table of Contents overview (Chs. 1–19), ensuring that case law, constitutional, statutory, rule-based, legislative, administrative, professional, and secondary-source citations each have dedicated rows aligned with their chapter-specific guidance.【F:temp/NOTES.md†L5-L111】【F:temp/NOTES.md†L113-L187】
- Chapter 1’s brief-formatting directives inform the italicization and signal usage conventions embedded across table entries, maintaining consistency with the Greenbook’s introductory typography rules.【F:temp/NOTES.md†L5-L44】【F:temp/NOTES.md†L113-L187】
- Appendices A–K supply abbreviation inventories and historical contexts that are reflected in the mandatory abbreviation columns for reporters, petition histories, codes, and agencies, confirming cross-references to every appendix-listed authority class.【F:temp/NOTES.md†L88-L111】【F:temp/NOTES.md†L113-L187】

### Stock Locale Comparison (locales-en-US.xml)
| Term | Draft 3 Value | Stock en-US Value | Override Needed? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rule` (short) | `R.` | `r.` (Oxford legal abbreviations)【4ef913†L1-L9】 | Yes – enforce capital R per Greenbook |
| `chapter` (short) | `ch.` | `chap.`【f7239e†L1-L6】 | Yes – match Greenbook contraction |
| `article` (short) | `art.` | _not defined_ (only long form present)【118bc8†L1-L2】 | Yes – add short form |
| `paragraph` (short) | `¶` | `para.`【4d2547†L1-L6】 | Yes – use pilcrow symbol |
| `section` (symbol) | `§` | `§`【b3a0ce†L21-L28】 | Optional – identical to stock |
| `and` | `and` | `and`【7c627c†L1-L3】 | Optional – identical to stock |

### Override Placement Recommendation
- Multiple in-progress drafts (Draft 3 and the table-of-authorities variants) repeat the same custom abbreviations for `article`, `chapter`, `rule`, and `section`/`paragraph`, which makes drift likely if each file hand-maintains overrides.【F:temp/texas-greenbook-15th-draft3.csl†L422-L428】【69b6f5†L3-L16】
- Creating a shared custom locale (e.g., `locales/locales-en-US-texas-greenbook.xml`) centralizes the Greenbook-specific abbreviations while letting each draft include it with `<locale>` references, ensuring that future drafts (Draft 4, TOA leaders) inherit updates automatically.
- The inline `<locale>` block can then shrink to only truly draft-specific terms (if any emerge), simplifying the style diff and keeping the main CSL focus on citation structure rather than terminology management.
