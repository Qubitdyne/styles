1  Briefs and Legal Memoranda

Two typefaces traditionally appear in briefs, memoranda, and similar 
material: roman and italics. The examples in The Greenbook follow 
this typeface convention, but the ﬁfteenth edition permits the usage of 
LARGE AND SMALL CAPITALS for stylistic purposes. This change was 
also adopted in the twentieth edition of The Bluebook. See Bluepages B2.

following material should be italicized:

signals are italicized:

or in identifying secondary sources are italicized:
