# Agent Instructions for `temp/`

## Purpose
This directory contains working materials for developing new CSL definitions for the *Texas Greenbook, 15th Edition*.

## Working Guidelines
- Treat the PDF and other reference documents as read-only source material.
- Maintain detailed inventories of CSL drafts and related test artifacts when making changes.
- Prefer incremental commits with clear messages referencing specific CSL drafts updated.
- Validate CSL changes against the JSON test suites in this directory before committing.
- When adding new CSL styles, preserve existing drafts by creating new versioned filenames rather than overwriting unless explicitly directed.
- Record any assumptions or unresolved questions in a dedicated `NOTES.md` file if needed.

## Reporting
- Summaries should enumerate updated CSL files and reference documents consulted.
- Cite relevant sections of the Greenbook PDF by page number when describing rule implementations.
