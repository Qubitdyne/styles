Appendix B  
Court of Appeals(cid:2)—(cid:2)1876 to 1892

The Court of Appeals of the State of Texas was created by the Consti-
tution of 1876 and given appellate jurisdiction in all criminal cases and 
a few civil cases. Only the opinions in criminal cases were officially 
reported. In 1892, its civil jurisdiction was removed, and it was renamed 
the Court of Criminal Appeals.

B.1  Criminal Cases
B.1.1  Texas Court of Appeals Reports

Opinions in criminal cases appeared in a separate set of reports begun 
by the State for criminal cases, the Texas Court of Appeals Reports 
(officially entitled Cases Argued and Adjudged in the Court of Appeals 
of the State of Texas). Cite cases from this reporter as follows, omitting 
the court designation in the date parenthetical as redundant:

Reynolds v. State, 14 Tex. Ct. App. 427, 428 (1883).

  B.1.2  Parallel Citations to the South Western Reporter

Citations to some cases in volume 21 and all cases in subsequent vol-
umes of the Texas Court of Appeals Reports should contain a parallel 
citation to the South Western Reporter:

Martin v. State, 21 Tex. Ct. App. 1, 10, 17 S.W. 430, 431 (1886).

Although citation to the Texas Court of Appeals Reports is preferred, the 
source may not be readily available. If the Texas Court of Appeals Reports 
is unavailable, cite the South Western Reporter only and parenthetically 
note the jurisdictional designation “Tex. Ct. App.” along with the year 
of decision. The following form is also acceptable:

Martin v. State, 17 S.W. 430, 431 (Tex. Ct. App. 1886).

Civil Cases

[(cid:3)B.2 

B.2  Civil Cases

The few civil cases decided by the old Texas Court of Appeals were 
privately reported, ﬁrst by Judges White and Willson and later by 
Judge Willson alone. The cases are found in the four-volume set of 
Condensed Reports of Decisions in Civil Causes in the Court of Appeals. 
Volume 1 should be cited as “White & W.” Volumes 2 through 4 should 
be cited as “Willson”:

Gibbons v. Braden, 1 White & W. 128, 129 (Tex. Ct. App. 1883).

Watson v. Cox, 2 Willson 209, 210 (Tex. Ct. App. 1884).

Sole or parallel citation to the South Western Reporter should be pro-
vided for cases appearing in volume 4 of Willson:

Durie v. Anderson, 16 S.W. 345, 346, 4 Willson 432, 433 (Tex. Ct.  
App. 1891).

Appendix C  
Commission of Appeals(cid:2)—(cid:2)1879 to 1892

C.1  1881 to 1892

Beginning in 1881, the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Ap-
peals could transfer cases to the Texas Commission of Appeals without 
the parties’ consent. The Commission’s opinions in cases referred by 
the Texas Court of Appeals were not published.1 

  C.1.1  Adopted Commission Decisions

Cases transferred to the Commission of Appeals by the Texas Supreme 
Court without the parties’ consent were published in either the Texas 
Reports, the South Western Reporter, or both. The Commission’s de-
cisions in these cases were adopted by the Court and should be cited 
according to Rule 2.3.1, Rule 2.3.2, Rule 5.2.2, and Appendix A.1:

Dwyer v. Olivari, 16 S.W. 800, 801 (Tex. [Comm’n Op.] 1891).

Burck v. Burroughs, 64 Tex. 445, 447 (1885).

Pardue v. James, 74 Tex. 299, 302, 12 S.W. 1, 2 (1889).

  C.1.2  Unadopted Commission Decisions

Cases transferred to the Commission by the Texas Supreme Court from 
1881 to 1884 with the parties’ consent were published in Posey’s Texas 
Unreported Cases. The Court did not adopt those decisions, and they do 
not serve as precedent. These cases should be attributed to the Texas 
Commission of Appeals according to Appendix C.2.

1. Professor Baade’s history of the Texas Supreme Court in the Reconstruction Era 
discusses this Commission of Appeals. See Hans W. Baade, Chapters in the History of the 
Supreme Court of Texas: Reconstruction and Redemption (1866–1882), 40 St. Mary’s L.J. 
17, 24, 31–32 (2008).

Cases from the Texas Supreme Court

[(cid:3)C.2.1 

Some opinions in volume 2 of Posey’s reports were published without a spe-
ciﬁc date. Cite these cases by giving an approximate date parenthetically:

Litton v. Thompson, 2 Posey 577, 578 (Tex. Comm’n App. between 1882 
and 1884) (not precedential).

  C.2  1879 to 1881

Before 1881, the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Appeals 
could refer cases to the Texas Commission of Appeals only with the 
parties’ consent. The Commission’s actions determined the outcome 
of the particular case and did not serve as precedent. Further, the State 
lacked statutory authorization to publish these opinions. These deci-
sions were included in two private reporters: Posey’s Texas Unreported 
Cases and White and Willson’s Condensed Reports of Decisions in Civil 
Causes in the Court of Appeals.

  C.2.1  Cases from the Texas Supreme Court

Posey’s two-volume compilation contains opinions of cases referred 
to the Commission by the parties’ consent from the Texas Supreme 
Court.2 When citing these decisions include the title, volume number, 
reporter (“Posey”), ﬁrst page of the decision, exact page on which the 
cited material appears, a date parenthetical including the court’s name 
(“Tex. Comm’n App.), and a precedential value parenthetical:

Mitchell v. Nix, 1 Posey 126, 135 (Tex. Comm’n App. 1880)  
(not precedential).

list Vernon Law Book Co. in Kansas City as the publisher.

  C.2.2  Cases from the Texas Court of Appeals

Volume 1 of White and Willson’s reports contains abridged opinions 
of cases referred to the Commission by the parties’ consent from the 
Texas Court of Appeals. Cite these decisions per Rule C.2.1, but with 
the proper reporter title (“White & W.”):

the law in all respects but determines that the petition 
presents no error that requires reversal or that is of 
such importance to the jurisprudence of the State as to 
require correction.

The Texas Supreme Court determines(cid:15)—(cid:15)after a re-
sponse has been ﬁled or requested(cid:15)—(cid:15)that the judgment 
of the court of appeals is correct and the legal principles 
announced in the opinion are likewise correct. The 
opinion of the court of appeals has the same preceden-
tial value as an opinion of the Texas Supreme Court.

The Texas Supreme Court has not reviewed the merits 
of the appeal, but has struck the petition for failure to 
comply with court rules, and has either required the pe-
titioner to revise the petition or has chosen to consider 
the case without allowing the petition to be revised.

Petition dismissed

P. 56.3

If the parties settle, on the joint motion of the parties 
the Texas Supreme Court may grant the petition for 
review and, without considering the merits, render a 
judgment to effectuate the agreement. It may alterna-
tively remand the cause to the trial court for rendition 
of judgment in accordance with the parties’ settlement 
agreement. The Court may dispose of a severable 
portion of the proceeding if it will not prejudice the 
remaining parties.

The opinion of the court of appeals is not vacated and 
has the precedential value of a petition dismissed case.

Prior Constitutions

  G.1  Prior Constitutions of the State of Texas

Always include the date of adoption when citing a Texas constitution 
that has been totally superseded(cid:15)—(cid:15)the constitutions of 1845, 1861, 
1866, and 1869:

Tex. Const. of 1869, art. III, § 3.

If the cited provision was added after the constitution was adopted, 
indicate the date of its addition parenthetically:

Tex. Const. of 1869, art. V, § 4 (1873).

Prior constitutions are reprinted in volume three of Vernon’s Annotated 
Constitution of the State of Texas and in H.P.N. Gammel’s ten-volume 
The Laws of Texas 1822–1897. It is unnecessary, however, to include a 
parallel citation to either of those sources.

  G.2  Constitutional Convention Ordinances

Ordinances adopted by a Texas constitutional convention prior to 1886 
carried the same weight as constitutional provisions. Gammel reprints 
these ordinances in full, while volume three of Vernon’s Annotated 
Constitution of the State of Texas includes only selected provisions. 
Ordinances should be cited to Gammel:

Tex. Ord. no. 11, § 7 (Mar. 30, 1866), reprinted in 5 H.P.N. Gammel, The 
Laws of Texas 1822–1897, at 895, 897 (Austin, Gammel Book Co. 1898).

  G.3  Constitution of the Republic of Texas

The constitution of the Republic of Texas should be cited to H.P.N. 
Gammel’s The Laws of Texas 1822–1897, although it is also reprinted in 
volume three of Vernon’s Annotated Constitution of the State of Texas:

Repub. Tex. Const. of 1836, art. III, § 1, reprinted in 1 H.P.N. Gammel, The 
Laws of Texas 1822–1897, at 1069, 1073 (Austin, Gammel Book Co. 1898).

  G.4  Constitution of the State of Coahuila and Texas

Prior to existing as the Republic of Texas, Texas was part of a Mexican 
state named Coahuila and Texas (sometimes called Coahuila y Tejas). 
The 1827 constitution of Coahuila and Texas should be cited to H.P.N. 
Gammel’s The Laws of Texas 1822–1897:

Coahuila & Tex. Const. of 1827, art. XX, § 2, reprinted in 1 H.P.N. Gammel, 
The Laws of Texas 1822–1897, at 423, 425 (Austin, Gammel Book Co. 1898).

  Practice Tip

Although H.P.N. Gammel’s compilation of nineteenth-century Texas 
legal materials was published over a century ago, it remains an important 
source for many legal materials relating to early Texas history, from 
colonial times through early statehood.

Appendix I  
Dates of Pre-1876 Legislative Sessions

Before the enactment of the 1876 constitution, the legislature did not 
always follow the present system of meeting for one biennial regular 
session and an indeﬁnite number of specially called sessions. Citation 
to these legislative sessions may require special designations, such as 
“Adj. S.” for “Adjourned Session,” “Prov. S.” for “Provisional Session,” 
and “2d R.S.” for “Second Regular Session.” Citations to session laws 
from the 1st, 2d, 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, and 15th Legislatures should simply 
omit the session designation because these Legislatures met for only 
one session. The Legislative Reference Library of Texas has further 
information about all legislative sessions on its website.

For full citation guidance for pre-1876 statutes, see Rule 11.2.

The  Texas  Rules  of  Form  was  originally 
drafted in 1966 as a simple effort to clarify the 
peculiarities of Texas legal citation. Roused by 
then-Judge  Joe  Greenhill’s  pathbreaking  work 
to  standardize  Texas  citation  form,  student 
editors  consulted  with  their  predecessor  and 
his  colleagues  on  the  Texas  Supreme  Court 
before  publishing  the  seventeen-page,  first 
edition  of  the  Rules.  In  the  fifty  years  since, 
it  has  grown  in  scope  to  include  practice  tips, 
legal  history,  and  detailed  citation  examples. 
But  its  purpose  remains  unchanged—to  aid 
those  wishing  to  navigate  the  idiosyncrasies 
of Texas’s legal landscape. The members of the 
Texas  Law  Review  hope  the  fifteenth  edition 
continues  to  serve  this  fundamental  purpose 
for our state and its practitioners.
