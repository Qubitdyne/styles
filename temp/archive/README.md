# Archived Texas Greenbook Drafts

The CSL files in this directory capture pre-version-control drafts that informed the current `texas-greenbook-15th-edition.csl`. Keep them unchanged unless you need to inspect historical decisions; all active development should occur in the edition style and its Table of Authorities companions in the parent directory.

## Documentation snapshots
- `README-2025-12-21.md`, `TODO-history-2025-12-21.md`, and `NOTES-2025-12-21.md` preserve the pre-cleanup documentation. Reference them for deep historical context instead of re-expanding the working copies in `temp/`.
