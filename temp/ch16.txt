 16.1 Administrative Rules and Regulations
Historical Note
In 1975, the Texas Legislature passed the Administrative Procedure and 
Texas Register Act, which provides for the publication of all proposed 
and adopted state administrative rules, regulations, and other related 
information in the Texas Register . In 1977 the Texas Legislature passed 
the Texas Administrative Code Act, which requires the compilation 
and indexing of administrative rules.
Today, proposed rules and regulations ﬁrst appear chronologically in the 
weekly Texas Register  along with their proposed Texas Administrative 
Code  citations. If the rules are adopted, the Texas Register  reports their 
adoption and any changes from the rules as initially proposed and pub-
lished. The rules are then compiled into the next annual supplement of 
the appropriate title of the Texas Administrative Code . The numbered 
titles of the Texas Administrative Code  are broad categories into which 
the state agencies are grouped (e.g., Health Services, Natural Resources 
and Conservation, Public Finance).
The Texas Register  and Texas Administrative Code  are both available 
through the Texas Secretary of State’s website.
 16.1.1  Texas Administrative Code
Whenever possible, cite Texas administrative rules and regulations to 
the Texas Administrative Code  (“Tex. Admin. Code”) by title, section, 
and year of the bound volume. Citations should include a parenthetical 
indicating the agency or organization issuing the rule and the subject 
heading of the rule. Abbreviate agencies in accordance with The Blue-
book  Tables T6 and T10:
4 Tex. Admin. Code § 9.12 (2013) (Tex. Dep’t of Agric., Seed Sampling 
Procedures).
 (a)  Rules Adopted or Amended After the Date of the Most Recent 
Texas Administrative Code. Cite rules adopted or amended after 
the date of the most recent annual Texas Administrative Code  to the 
Texas Register  under Rule 16.1.2 . Texas Administrative Code

--- PAGE 96 ---
78AGENCY MATERIAL 16.1.2 ] 
 (b)  Rules No Longer in Force. For rules no longer in force, cite to either 
the Texas Register  or the Texas Administrative Code , but include the 
designation “ repealed by ” followed by a full citation to the repealing 
rule in the Texas Register  under Rule 16.1.2 :
19 Tex. Admin. Code § 89.1260 (2006) (Tex. Educ. Agency, Monitoring of 
Programs and Enforcing Law and Commissioner’s Rules), repealed by 32 
Tex. Reg. 3825, 3826 (2007),  adopted by 32 Tex. Reg. 6311, 6311 (2007).
 16.1.2  Texas Register
When citing proposed rules in the Texas Register , provide the volume, 
the publication name (“Tex. Reg.”), the page at which the rule begins, 
the exact page of the cited material, and the year in which the cited 
volume was published. In addition, cite parenthetically the location 
in the Texas Administrative Code  where the rule is to be codiﬁed (see 
Rule 16.1.2(a) ). A separate parenthetical must also include the name 
of the agency or organization proposing the rule and, if useful for clarity, 
either the title of the proposed rule or, when citing multiple sections, 
the narrowest subject heading that applies to all cited sections. If 
particularly relevant, the exact date the rule was proposed may also 
be included in a separate parenthetical:
39 Tex. Reg. 982, 982 (2014) (to be codiﬁed at 16 Tex. Admin. Code 
§ 33.13) (proposed Oct. 25, 2013) (Tex. Alcoholic Beverages Comm’n, 
Application Procedures), proposed by  38 Tex. Reg. 7403, 7404 (2013).
39 Tex. Reg. 573, 574 (2014) (to be codiﬁed at 22 Tex. Admin. Code 
§ 367.14) (proposed Feb. 7, 2014) (Tex. State Bd. Plumbing Exam’rs, 
Contested Case; State Office of Admin. Hearings).
Unless otherwise noted within this rule, abbreviations for Texas Reg-
ister citations should be in accordance with The Bluebook  Tables T6, 
T9, T10, and T12.
 (a)  Location in the Texas Administrative Code . The parenthetical 
citation to the Texas Administrative Code  should indicate whether the 
rule is newly codiﬁed (“to be codiﬁed at”) or merely an amendment to 
an existing rule (“to be codiﬁed as an amendment to”):

--- PAGE 97 ---
79[ 16.1.2  
39 Tex. Reg. 557, 558 (2014) (to be codiﬁed as an amendment to 1 
Tex. Admin. Code § 353.405) (Tex. Health & Human Servs. Comm’n, 
Marketing).
 (b)  Amendments to Proposed Rules. The Texas Register  will report 
adoption of, or proposed changes to, previously proposed rules. If a 
previously proposed rule has been amended since its proposal and is 
to be adopted as amended, then the full, amended text of the rule will 
be printed with the notiﬁcation of its adoption. In this case, cite to the 
text as published with the adoption notice. The previous publication 
of the originally proposed text need not be cited.
However, if a rule is adopted unchanged, the text will not be reprinted on 
the page at which it is adopted in the Texas Register . It will be necessary 
to cite to both the page at which it is proposed — at which the text of the 
rule is located — and the page at which it is adopted in the Texas Register .
First, cite the location at which it is proposed followed by the desig-
nation “ adopted by ” and a full citation to the adopting provision under 
Rule 16.1.2 :
38 Tex. Reg. 8492, 8493 (2013), adopted by  39 Tex. Reg. 623, 623 (2014) 
(to be codiﬁed as an amendment to 10 Tex. Admin. Code § 1.10) (Tex. 
Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs, Public Comment Procedures).
 (c)  Emergency Rules.
 Practice Tip
Emergency rules are rules adopted to prevent imminent peril to the 
public and are effective without notice for a maximum period of 180 
days. Emergency rules are not codiﬁed in the Texas Administrative 
Code  but typically amend, repeal, or add a temporary section to the 
Code. Emergency rules are published in the Texas Register .
Cite an emergency rule per Rule 16.1.2 , adding a parenthetical fol-
lowing the year of the Texas Register  in which the rule appears that 
indicates the emergency rule’s location in and its relationship to  the  Texas Register

--- PAGE 98 ---

repeals (“emerg. repeal”), or adds a new section to (“emerg. rule”) the 
affected code portion.  The dates of adoption and expiration are listed 
in a second parenthetical:

Code §§ 19.411, 19.413) (adopted Sept. 12, 2008, expired Dec. 24, 2008) 
(Tex. Dep’t Agric., Quarantined Areas; Restrictions).
15 Tex. Reg. 2075, 2075 (1990) (emerg. repeal of 28 Tex. Admin. Code 
§§ 64.5, 64.10, 64.15, 64.20) (adopted Apr. 4, 1990, expired Aug. 2, 1990) 
(Tex. Workers’ Comp. Comm’n, Requirement for Written Contract; 
Attorney Fees; Expenses; Disbursement Statement).
In the same issue of the Texas Register , a rule may be adopted on an 
emergency basis and proposed as a permanent rule. If the rule is perma-
nently adopted unchanged, the text will not be reprinted. When citing 
such a rule, analogize to Rule 16.1.2(b) : the emergency rule is ﬁrst cited, 
followed thereafter by a citation to the location in the Texas Register 
where the emergency rule was proposed as a permanent rule, followed 
by the location in the Texas Register at which the rule is adopted as a 
permanent rule. That string is then followed by a parenthetical indicating 
the location of the affected section of the Texas Administrative Code  
and a separate parenthetical indicating the agency name and, if useful 
for clarity, either the title of the proposed rule or, when citing multiple 
sections, the narrowest subject heading that applies to all cited sections:
34 Tex. Reg. 6202, 6206–08 (2009) (emerg. rule), proposed by  35 
Tex. Reg. 181, 181, 197–201 (2010), adopted by  35 Tex. Reg. 2160, 2160,

5.4911), amended by  36 Tex. Reg. 9331, 9333–34 (2011) (codiﬁed as an 
amendment to 28 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 5.4903, 5.4905) (Tex. Dep’t  
of Ins.).

 (d)  Rules No Longer in Force. Rules no longer in force are cited according 
to Rule 16.1.2 . This citation should be followed by a full citation to the 
amending or repealing rule and a parenthetical indicating the former 
section of the Texas Administrative Code at which the rule was codiﬁed. 
Indicate whether the original rule was amended or repealed before the 
citation to the amending or repealing rule:
10 Tex. Reg. 4562, 4562–64 (1985), adopted by  11 Tex. Reg. 126, 126 
(1986), repealed in part and amended in part by  11 Tex. Reg. 2408, 2408–11

 (e)  Other Materials Found in the Texas Register . The Texas Register  
is required by statute to publish a variety of materials beyond admin-
istrative rules, including executive orders, attorney general opinions, 
and other agency materials, like applications, proposals, and notices. 
When citing such material, include its title or a description indicating 
its nature, along with the volume of the Texas Register , the ﬁrst page

 16.1.3 Rules Promulgated Before 1976
Historical Note
Rules promulgated by administrative agencies before January 1, 1976, 
do not appear in the Texas Register . Official copies of these rules and 
regulations are on ﬁle at the offices of the respective agencies.
Before 1976, administrative rules were identiﬁed by a ten-digit number 
divided into four units by decimal points. In 1977, with the advent of 
the Texas Administrative Code , this numbering system fell into disuse. 
It is increasingly difficult to locate rules using their former ten-digit 
identiﬁer, so even if a rule bears one, it should be cited as indicated below. 
Rules promulgated before 1976 are cited by agency and date of adoption. 
Cite such a rule according to the promulgating agency’s identiﬁcation 
system, followed by a parenthetical indicating the rule’s repeal and the 
date of that repeal. Include any information that would help a reader 
ﬁnd the rule parenthetically:
Tex. R.R. Comm’n, Rule 400b (1964) (repealed 1976) (on ﬁle with the 
Texas Railroad Commission).
 16.2 Administrative Orders
Cite orders of state agencies by name of the agency or commission, title 
of the adjudication or order, docket or order number, and a parenthetical 
indicating the exact date. A parenthetical noting the disposition of the 
cause may follow the date parenthetical. If agency opinions are pub-
lished in a series, include a citation to this publication by volume, title, 
page, and date. If the order was issued by a particular division of the 
agency, indicate the division in the date parenthetical. Abbreviate using 
the following conventions: agency names and divisions in accordance 
with The Bluebook Tables T6 and T10; dates in accordance with The 
Bluebook  Table T12; and agency publications in accordance with The 
Bluebook Table T13. Agency publications with a common abbreviation in 
Texas, but not found in The Bluebook , may nevertheless be abbreviated. 
For example, the Texas Public Utility Commission Bulletin is often 

--- PAGE 101 ---
83[ 16.3.1 Pamphlets of Limited Circulation
abbreviated “Tex. P .U.C. Bull.” and may be cited as such. The title of an 
adjudication, however, is not abbreviated:
Tex. Pub. Util. Comm’n, Application of Southwestern Bell T elephone 
Company for Authority to Implement Private Coin Service , Docket No. 
5905, 10 Tex. P.U.C. Bull. 1424, 1426 (Mar. 8, 1985) (ﬁnal order granting 
application).
Tex. R.R. Comm’n, Enforcement Action Against Westco Gas, Inc. for 
Violations of the T exas Administrative Code, Utilities Code, and Pipeline 
Safety Regulations , Docket No. 8983, Gas Util. Info. Bull. No. 713, 3  
(Gas Servs. Div. Dec. 3, 2002) (proposed ﬁnal order).
 16.3 Reports, Studies, and Bulletins
 Practice Tip
Publications of state agencies (e.g., reports, studies, newsletters, and 
bulletins) are collected and processed by the Texas State Publications 
Clearinghouse and are available for loan from the Reference Room of 
the Texas State Library. Most documents are available in microﬁche 
format from the Records Management Division of the Texas State 
Library. Selected publications are distributed to depository libraries, 
which are located in many of the major academic and public libraries 
throughout the state. Agency publications may also be available online.
Cite reports, studies, and bulletins published by administrative agencies 
in pamphlet form as a book, in accordance with Rule 18.1 .
 16.3.1 Pamphlets of Limited Circulation
Cite pamphlets of limited circulation per Rule 18.1 , but include the 
exact date if available and parenthetically add any information that 
might be helpful  in locating the source:
